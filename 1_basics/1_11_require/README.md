# 1.11 Require

## Todo
* update the `f` function inf `contacts/Contract.sol` so that it fails if the argument is not an even number.  Make the contract call return a message that corresponds with the `deploy.js` script is expecting.  Use a `require` call. 

## Running
Run the `run.sh` command to make sure you see a success message.
