# Solidity Koans #

Learn Solidity incrementally via small exercises called "koans", which are bite-sized problems that require knowledge of a specific facet.

## Getting started ##

### Prerequisites

* `docker` installed

### Running Koans

Each koan is self-contained.  You can jump around as much as you like, skipping sections or individual koans.  To do a koan, `cd` into the directory and read the README.  Most koans follow the following pattern, if they do not, then instructions will be in the README.

In the koan directory, execute `./run.sh`.  There may or may not be logs, but this should succeed with a `SUCCESS` message or fail with some informative error about where to look or what was expected.
